    "# Configure Target Users\n",
    "In this notebook, we add users to the delivery org and invite them to groups. Users will be able to find the invites to the new groups on the 'Groups' tab or in their notifications. \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the group IDs for the featured group and for any groups in the project org you will be adding delivery org users to.\n",
    "2. Set up the csv file of users. This csv should have columns for email, firstname, lastname, username, password, role, level, and groups. The groups column should contain group IDs that are separated by commas. There is a sample user csv in the Sample Config folder, and there is more information about formatting [`here`](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/set-up-an-arcgis-enterprise-portal/lessons/add-members-to-the-organization.htm) in steps 4 & 5. Make sure that the User Roles you choose are able to be added to groups in other organizations! The default 'Viewer' role is not able to be added to groups outside of the organization.\n",
    "3. Change the variables in cell 1. Example variables:\n",
    "    - TARGET_URL = \"https://esrienergy.maps.arcgis.com\"\n",
    "    - TARGET_USERNAME = \"portaladmin\"\n",
    "    - GROUP_IDS = [\"a7903db4086641b98570bce5856a6364\", \"4d7ff4f81d6340428ef290b7de801204\"]\n",
    "    - FEATURED_GROUP_ID = \"4f4fcac023dc430294cea226231ab448\"\n",
    "4. Run the notebook cell by cell.\n",
    "    - In code cell 4, you will need to enter the passwords for the delivery organizations when prompted\n",
    "    - In code cell 6, the script will print out the users that were added to the delivery org and the groups they were added to\n",
    "5. At the end, your delivery org should have all the users in the csv file added and each should get an invitation in their Organization Account for each group listed for them. Once they accept it, they will be shown in the group members in the Project Organization as well. The delivery org will also be customized."
